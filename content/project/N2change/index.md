Cold and dense Antarctica Bottom Water (AABW) forms near the
coastline of Antarctica, sinks to the ocean bottom, moves northward in deep branches of the Meridional
Overturning Circulation, becomes lighter through mixing, and eventually upwells to shallower depths. The
AABW properties change under the changing climate. Repeat hydrography sections occupied approximately
once per decade since the 1990s have revealed continuously warming and freshening of the AABW. In many
regions of the ocean, the warming and freshening trends are strongest at the bottom. This causes a decrease in
the vertical gradient of density, namely stratification. As the level of mixing is strongly related to stratification,
it is important to quantify its trend and understand its spatial structure. I quantify the trend in stratification
globally and find a reduction in stratification in the Southern Ocean and along the spreading pathways of the
AABW at lower latitudes.
