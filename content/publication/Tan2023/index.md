abstract: The density stratification in the ocean is directly related to the diapycnal mixing, which drives the abyssal cell of the Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC). It is important to understand how stratification has been changing in the world's deep and abyssal oceans under climate change. Using repeat hydrographic data obtained since the 1990s, we find a decreasing stratification associated with changes in the source Antarctica Bottom Water (AABW) properties in its formation basins as well as in basins along its dispersal pathways. Averaged south of 60°S, the squared buoyancy frequency N2 shows a negative trend of −6% per decade in waters deeper than 4,000 m. The observed decadal reduction in stratification is associated with large spatial variability, especially in the Southern Ocean basins with multiple AABW sources. Additionally, there are also significant differences between neighboring basins that are related to the blocking effect of topography.
