<!-- Shuwen Tan is a US GO-SHIP Postdoctoral Fellow at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University. She is broadly interested in physical processes in the Earth's Oceans.  -->
Shuwen Tan (谭舒文) is a Postdoctoral Scholar at UC, Irvine. In the past, she was heavily engaged in developing rotating hydraulic theories and interpreting observations of deep (water depth >2000 m sometimes >5000 m) ocean sill overflows. Her project at UCI, however, focuses on exciting behaviors of nonlinear waves approaching an island (Dongsha Atoll, 2 m ~ 600 m) using modeling approaches. So she is currently transitioning from an observationalist to a modeler and happy to continue playing with waves.
