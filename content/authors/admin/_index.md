<!-- Shuwen Tan is a US GO-SHIP Postdoctoral Fellow at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University. She is broadly interested in physical processes in the Earth's Oceans.  -->
<!-- Shuwen Tan (谭舒文) is a Postdoctoral Scholar at UC, Irvine. In the past, she was heavily engaged in developing rotating hydraulic theories and interpreting observations of deep (water depth >2000 m sometimes >5000 m) ocean sill overflows (check out our latest [GO-SHIP cruises](https://usgoship.ucsd.edu/) where we obtain measurements and samples within 10 meters above the sea floor!). Her project at UCI, however, focuses on exciting behaviors of nonlinear waves approaching an island (Dongsha Atoll, 2 m ~ 600 m) using modeling approaches. So she is currently transitioning from an observationalist to a modeler and happy to continue playing with waves. -->
**I am looking for PhD students to start in Fall 2025, especially those interested in modeling wave- or flow-topography interactions. Please {{< staticref "uploads/tan_2025.pdf" "newtab" >}}click{{< /staticref >}} for more information.**

I will start as an Assistant Professor in Physical Oceanography at the University of Connecticut on January 1st, 2025. My research focuses on oceanic processes driven by interactions with topography, including dense overflows, flow hydraulics, internal waves, and turbulent mixing, as well as their impacts on Earth’s climate. My lab at UConn, the Ocean Dynamics and Climate Lab, aims to use a combination of theoretical approaches, numerical models, and in-situ observations to (1) improve the fundamental understanding of multi-scale topographic effects in stratified ocean flows and (2) assess how the ocean changes under climate change, providing geophysical insights to help evaluate and mitigate climate-related risks.
